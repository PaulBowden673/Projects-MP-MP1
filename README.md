# Mr Shiraz
( Add Hero Imaage)

>I built this website to showcase the talents of Mr Shiraz, It displays the bands albums, with links to an external site to purchase, Photos of the band members and quotes from Interviews and reviews of Mr Shiraz. It also has a sign up page for updates on the band, a bookings page for users to book the band for gigs and events. I have included video and audio files so thaat users can listen to/watch the band perform. I have focused on a user friendly design giving users a great experience when using the website.
## UX
>The purpose of this project is to create a static (front-end only) website for a well known Huddersfield based band who have around 20 years experience of performing live at numerous events around the world. The target audiences for this website are fans of Mr Shiraz and potential fans who would like to use the site to hear clips from their back catalog and buy related merchandise.

**I incorperated the following things in order for the target audience to have a great experience when visiting my website,**

- Audio clips for visitors to listen to some of the bands songs
- A video file so the visitors can view the band performing their latest video
- A sign up page for the user to register to receive information on Mr Shiraz's mailing ist.
- Information about the band and quotes from interviews done by Music magazines and Websites
- A bookings page so users can book the band for events
- Social media links for users to follow to stay up to date with any news the band may have
- I have matched the design of the webpage to suit the style of the band (which is Northern Groove Punk) using colours accociated with thier album artwork and style, to give a good overall user experience.
